Library to parse and apply unified diffs.

|Build Status|

Features

-  Python 2 and 3 compatible
-  Automatic correction of
-  Linefeeds according to patched file
-  Diffs broken by stripping trailing whitespace
-  a/ and b/ prefixes
-  Single file, which is a command line tool and a library
-  No dependencies outside Python stdlib
-  Patch format detection (SVN, HG, GIT)
-  Nice diffstat histogram
-  Linux / Windows / OS X
-  Test coverage

Things that don't work out of the box:

-  File renaming, creation and removal
-  Directory tree operations
-  Version control specific properties
-  Non-unified diff formats

Usage
~~~~~

Download **patch.py** and run it with Python. It is a self-contained
module without external dependencies.

::

    patch.py diff.patch

You can also run the .zip file.

::

    python patch-1.16.zip diff.patch

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**patch.py** is self sufficient. You can copy it into your repository
and use it from here. This setup will always be repeatable. But if you
need to add ``patch`` module as a dependency, make sure to use strict
specifiers to avoid hitting an API break when version 2 is released:

::

    pip install "patch==1.*"
